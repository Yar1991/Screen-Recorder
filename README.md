# Screen Recorder

Built with openCV, customtkinter, and other packages, a super simple screen recorder.
Just choose a folder where to save the recording, click "Start" and there you go.
You might adjust the frames or the recording time limit if needed.
Also, if you want to create an .exe, you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/wiki/Packaging).
